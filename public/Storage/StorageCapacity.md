### 4. **How Much They Store**:

Each storage mechanism in JavaScript has different storage limits, and understanding these limits is crucial for choosing the right option for your data storage needs. Below are the typical storage limits for each type and examples of when you might exceed those limits.

---

#### **LocalStorage**:

- **Storage Limit**: Typically 5 MB per domain, but this may vary slightly depending on the browser (some browsers may allow more).
- **When You Might Exceed the Limit**:

  - Storing large datasets like user preferences, images, or logs.
  - Persisting large amounts of JSON data (e.g., large configurations, application state).
  - Saving high-resolution media or large arrays of complex objects.

  **Example**:

  - If you try to store large user-generated content (e.g., 100 MB of images or video metadata) in LocalStorage, you'll quickly exceed the storage limit, causing errors like "QuotaExceededError."

---

#### **SessionStorage**:

- **Storage Limit**: The storage limit is similar to LocalStorage, typically around 5 MB per domain. However, because data is cleared when the session ends, this is less of a concern for long-term storage.

- **When You Might Exceed the Limit**:

  - Storing large amounts of temporary data that exceeds the limit for session-based storage.
  - Saving complex objects (e.g., session data, forms) with a lot of nested data.

  **Example**:

  - If you're storing a large user profile object with thousands of characters (e.g., if the object is a userâ€™s entire browsing history or preferences), it may hit the limit if stored in SessionStorage.

---

#### **Cookies**:

- **Storage Limit**: Cookies are limited to around 4 KB per cookie (including the name, value, and metadata like expiration date).
- **When You Might Exceed the Limit**:

  - Attempting to store more than small, simple key-value pairs like user session IDs or tokens.
  - Storing long strings or complex objects (e.g., large authentication tokens, serialized objects).

  **Example**:

  - If you try to store a large object like an authentication token or a serialized array with user data directly in a cookie, it will exceed the 4 KB limit and potentially cause issues.

---

#### **IndexedDB**:

- **Storage Limit**: IndexedDB has a much higher storage capacity compared to other browser storage mechanisms, typically ranging from hundreds of MB to several GB, depending on the browser. Some browsers will ask for permission if the storage exceeds a certain threshold.

- **When You Might Exceed the Limit**:

  - Storing large datasets like images, videos, or large JSON objects.
  - Using IndexedDB to store data-intensive applications such as databases of products or user-generated content.

  **Example**:

  - If you're using IndexedDB to store a photo album with images over 100 MB, or you try to store a complex, multi-level object with tens of thousands of records, you could approach or exceed the browser's limit for IndexedDB.

---

#### **Cache API**:

- **Storage Limit**: The Cache API allows you to cache resources like images, scripts, and API responses. The storage capacity for the Cache API varies by browser but is often large, typically in the range of hundreds of MB or more.

- **When You Might Exceed the Limit**:

  - Storing large media files (e.g., videos, images) or large numbers of static assets (e.g., hundreds of JS or CSS files).
  - Over-caching content, leading to the storage limit being exceeded.

  **Example**:

  - If you're caching high-resolution images, videos, or large API responses that exceed the storage limits for Cache API, you might hit the maximum storage capacity and cause failures or data evictions.

#### **Summary of Storage Limits**:

| Storage Type       | Typical Storage Limit | Examples of Exceeding the Limit                         |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **LocalStorage**   | ~5 MB per domain      | Large JSON objects, user profile data, media metadata   |
| **SessionStorage** | ~5 MB per domain      | Large session data, user preferences, temporary objects |
| **Cookies**        | ~4 KB per cookie      | Large authentication tokens, serialized user data       |
| **IndexedDB**      | Hundreds of MB to GB  | Large datasets (photos, videos, complex objects)        |
| **Cache API**      | Hundreds of MB to GB  | High-resolution images, videos, large API responses     |
